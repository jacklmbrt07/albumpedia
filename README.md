Albumpedia app by Jack Lambert, July 2020

A simple app which retrieves data from [www.theaudiodb.com](www.theaudiodb.com)

Enter in a musician or music Artist in the search bar, click search button, and
a wiki like webpage will render showing the artists stats, photo, biography.

below that is a table of the artist's published recordings, sorted by albums, EPs, and Live albums. 

click the album cover image to see a magnified version
click 'review' to see a review from a critic
click 'tracklist' to see name of tracks within the album.

languages used:
HTML 
CSS
Javascript
Bootstrap
jQuery
MDBootstrap (for flag icons)

API Key is hidden, since i am a patreon contributer.

three ajax requests are used, one to retrieve artist info and another to retrieve album info and a third to retrieve tracklisting

local storage is used so when page is refreshed, information from current search is rendered.

Homepage is included.

modals are used in album details.
