The `generateAlbumHTML` function takes the album data about the specified artist retrieved the database, sorts it in chronological order, and then is called based on the type of format specified. Notice the index used in the span of the last table data, which is used in the `toggleReviewModal` function.

With help from my instructor, I was able to successfully pull the data from the API and generate inside the single modal, rather than generating one modal per each album.
